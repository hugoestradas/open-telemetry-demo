## Slide 3: Our Simple Demo Architecture
```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐

```

**KISS Principle Applied:**
- **Keep**: Core functionality and tracing
- **It**: Focused on essentials
- **Simple**: One file per component
- **Stupid**: So simple anyone can understand

**Speaker Notes:**
- Deliberately simple to focus on OpenTelemetry concepts
- Each component has one clear responsibility
- Real-world apps follow the same patterns, just larger scale
- Complexity is in the observability, not the application

## Slide 4: OpenTelemetry Integration - Zero to Hero

### Step 1: Add Dependency (1 line)
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-opentelemetry</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

### Step 2: Configure Endpoint (2 lines)
```properties
quarkus.application.name=simple-login
quarkus.otel.exporter.otlp.traces.endpoint=http://jaeger:14250
```

### Step 3: Add Custom Tracing (3 lines)
```java
Span span = tracer.spanBuilder("login").startSpan();
span.setAttribute("user", username);
span.end();
```

**That's It! 🎉**

**Speaker Notes:**
- OpenTelemetry integration is surprisingly simple
- Quarkus provides auto-instrumentation out of the box
- Custom spans add business context to technical traces
- Most of the "magic" happens automatically

---

## Slide 5: The Complete Backend Code
```java
@Path("/api")
public class LoginApp {
    @Inject Tracer tracer;

    @POST @Path("/login")
    public Map<String, Object> login(Map<String, String> request) {
        Span span = tracer.spanBuilder("login").startSpan();
        
        try {
            String user = request.get("username");
            String pass = request.get("password");
            
            span.setAttribute("user", user);
            
            // Simple auth - KISS principle
            boolean valid = ("admin".equals(user) && "password".equals(pass)) || 
                           ("demo".equals(user) && "demo".equals(pass));
            
            span.setAttribute("result", valid ? "success" : "failed");
            
            return Map.of(
                "success", valid,
                "message", valid ? "Login successful!" : "Invalid credentials",
                "token", valid ? "simple-token-" + user : null
            );
        } finally {
            span.end();
        }
    }
}
```

**50 lines. That's the entire backend.**

**Speaker Notes:**
- This is the complete backend implementation
- Notice how tracing is woven into business logic
- Span attributes provide business context
- Try/finally ensures spans are always closed
- Real applications follow exactly this pattern

---

## Slide 6: Automatic vs Manual Instrumentation

### 🤖 Automatic (Quarkus Provides)
- ✅ HTTP requests/responses
- ✅ Database queries
- ✅ External API calls
- ✅ Message queues
- ✅ Context propagation

### 👋 Manual (We Add)
- ✅ Business logic spans
- ✅ Custom attributes
- ✅ Error conditions
- ✅ Performance markers
- ✅ User context

### 🎯 Result: Complete Visibility
Every request generates a trace with both technical and business context.

**Speaker Notes:**
- OpenTelemetry gives you 80% observability automatically
- Manual instrumentation adds the business context that matters
- The combination provides complete request visibility
- Start with automatic, add manual where it adds value

---

## Slide 7: Docker - One Command Demo

### docker-compose.yml (Simplified)
```yaml
services:
  jaeger:
    image: jaegertracing/all-in-one:latest
    ports: ["16686:16686", "14250:14250"]

  backend:
    build: ./backend
    ports: ["8080:8080"]
    environment:
      - QUARKUS_OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT=http://jaeger:14250

  frontend:
    build: ./frontend
    ports: ["3000:80"]
```

### One Command Startup
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

**Speaker Notes:**
- Complete observability stack in one command
- Jaeger provides both collection and visualization
- Environment variables configure the connection
- Same pattern works for any deployment environment

---

## Slide 8: Live Demo Time! 🎬

### What We'll See:
1. **🚀 Start Everything**
   - `docker-compose up --build`
   - Three services start automatically

2. **🌐 Use the App**
   - Simple login form at localhost:3000
   - Try both success and failure scenarios

3. **🔍 Analyze Traces**
   - Jaeger UI at localhost:16686
   - See spans, timing, and attributes

4. **📊 Discover Insights**
   - Request duration breakdown
   - Success vs failure patterns
   - User behavior tracking

**Speaker Notes:**
- We'll start with the application running
- Focus on the tracing aspects, not the app functionality

---

## Slide 9: Jaeger UI Walkthrough

### 🔍 Finding Traces
- **Service**: Select "simple-login"
- **Operation**: Choose "login" or "GET /"
- **Time Range**: Last hour
- **Tags**: Filter by user, result, etc.

### 📊 Trace Analysis
- **Timeline**: See request duration
- **Spans**: Drill into components
- **Attributes**: Business context
- **Errors**: Red spans show issues

### 🎯 Key Insights
- Which operations are slow?
- What's the error rate?
- How do users behave?
- Where are the bottlenecks?

**Speaker Notes:**
- Jaeger UI is intuitive and powerful
- Filtering capabilities help find specific scenarios
- Span details provide debugging context
- This is where the business value becomes clear

## Slide 10: What a Successful Login Trace Shows

```
📊 Successful Login Trace (Total: ~150ms)
├── 🌐 HTTP GET / (5ms)
│   └── Frontend loads
├── 🔐 HTTP POST /api/login (145ms)
│   ├── 🛡️ login span (140ms)
│   │   ├── user: "demo"
│   │   ├── result: "success"
│   │   └── token: "simple-token-demo"
│   └── 📤 Response sent (5ms)
```

### Key Attributes Captured:
- **Technical**: http.method, http.status_code, http.route
- **Business**: user, result, token
- **Performance**: span.duration, operation timing
- **Context**: trace.id, span.id for correlation

**Speaker Notes:**
- This hierarchical view shows the complete request flow
- Timing information helps identify bottlenecks
- Business attributes provide debugging context
- Technical attributes are captured automatically

---

## Slide 11: Failed Login vs Successful Login

### 🔴 Failed Login Pattern
```
❌ Failed Login (Total: ~50ms)
└── 🔐 login span
    ├── user: "wronguser"
    ├── result: "failed"
    └── No token generated
```

### ✅ Successful Login Pattern
```
✅ Successful Login (Total: ~150ms)
└── 🔐 login span
    ├── user: "demo"
    ├── result: "success"
    └── token: "simple-token-demo"
```

### 📈 Observable Differences:
- **Duration**: Failed logins are faster (no token generation)
- **Attributes**: Result field shows success/failure
- **Patterns**: Can identify brute force attempts
- **User Experience**: Measure authentication performance

**Speaker Notes:**
- Tracing reveals patterns not visible in logs
- Performance differences tell a story
- Security teams can identify attack patterns
- Product teams can optimize user experience

## Slide 15: Best Practices from Our Simple App

### ✅ Do This
```java
// Meaningful span names
tracer.spanBuilder("user_authentication")

// Business-relevant attributes
span.setAttribute("user.id", userId);
span.setAttribute("auth.method", "password");

// Proper error handling
span.setStatus(StatusCode.ERROR);
span.recordException(exception);

// Always close spans
try (Scope scope = span.makeCurrent()) {
    // work here
} finally {
    span.end();
}
```

### ❌ Avoid This
- Generic span names like "process" or "handle"
- Including sensitive data in attributes
- Creating spans for every small operation
- Forgetting to end spans

**Speaker Notes:**
- Quality over quantity in instrumentation
- Business context is more valuable than technical detail
- Security and privacy considerations are important
- Proper span lifecycle management prevents memory leaks

---

## Slide 16: Scaling Considerations

### 📊 Sampling Strategies
```properties
# Development: Trace everything
quarkus.otel.traces.sampler=always_on

# Production: Sample based on load
quarkus.otel.traces.sampler=traceidratio
quarkus.otel.traces.sampler.arg=0.1  # 10%

# Custom: Business-driven sampling
# Sample all errors, 1% of success
```

### 🚀 Performance Impact
- **CPU Overhead**: < 5% typically
- **Memory Usage**: ~1KB per trace
- **Network**: Asynchronous export
- **Storage**: Consider retention policies

### 💡 Pro Tips
- Start with high sampling in development
- Reduce sampling in production based on volume
- Always sample errors and slow requests
- Monitor the monitoring system itself

**Speaker Notes:**
- Observability shouldn't hurt performance
- Sampling is crucial for high-volume systems
- Business-critical operations deserve higher sampling
- Monitor costs and adjust sampling accordingly
